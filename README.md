# E-Electricity-Application-JAVA_SWING-
E-Billing of Electricity based upon units consumed by user.
This a Java Swing application to calculate electricity units consumed by user on daily basis & sum them up at the end of duration(can be 1 or 2 months).
So user has to register 1st in the system & then create an account on platform using his/her details like name,mobile_number,address,email, password,etc.. 
In this I've used random number generator to allocate random number on basis of name to user.
Each user is allocated a recharge card & then he/she has to make a recharge of certain units(According to convenience).
After units are consumed then he/she would be prompted by system to do further recharge or their connection would be cut down.
Mysql Database is Database used at backend with Java Swing for designing.
I've uploaded some of the screeenshots of my application.
